# Laser-Stopwatch
Requires an Arduino, two photocells, sd card, sd shield, and two lasers. The lasers when pointed on the photocell cause the photocell to read a high value. When an object passes through laser blocking the light from hitting the photcell, the photocell will read a low va;ue. This is used as the start/stop signal for the stopwatch.
